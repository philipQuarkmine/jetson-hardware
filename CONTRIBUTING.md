# Contributing Guidelines

Thank you for contributing to the jetson-hardware project! This document outlines the standards and practices for contributing to this robotics/embedded systems codebase.

## Development Environment

Before contributing, set up the recommended development environment:

1. **Read**: `docs/Development_Environment_Setup.md` for complete setup instructions
2. **Install**: Ruff extension for VS Code (primary linter)
3. **Remove**: Pylance and Pylint extensions to prevent conflicts
4. **Verify**: Files appear white (clean) in VS Code file explorer after setup

## Code Standards

### Formatting & Linting
- **Auto-formatting**: Code is automatically formatted with Ruff on save
- **Import organization**: Imports are auto-sorted following hardware development patterns
- **Line length**: 88-100 characters (configurable in pyproject.toml)
- **No manual formatting needed**: Ruff handles all formatting automatically

### Hardware-Specific Code Patterns

This project allows hardware-friendly patterns that strict linters often reject:

#### ‚úÖ **Acceptable Patterns:**
```python
# Bare except for hardware error handling
try:
    device.read_sensor()
except:
    # Hardware can fail unpredictably - broad exception is OK
    return default_value

# Module-level imports after hardware initialization
import os
gi.require_version('Gst', '1.0') 
from gi.repository import Gst  # OK after gi setup

# Hardware placeholder variables
buf = sample.get_buffer()  # May be used conditionally based on hardware
caps = sample.get_caps()   # Runtime hardware determines usage

# Direct hardware memory access
GPIO_BASE = 0x7E200000
register = ctypes.c_uint32.from_address(GPIO_BASE + offset)
```

#### ‚ùå **Avoid These Patterns:**
```python
# Don't use contextlib.suppress for hardware (prefer explicit)
with contextlib.suppress(Exception):  # ‚ùå Too implicit for hardware debugging
    hardware_operation()

# Don't use auto-context managers for file locking
with open(lock_file) as f:  # ‚ùå Hardware locking needs explicit control
    fcntl.lockf(f, fcntl.LOCK_EX)
```

## Architecture Guidelines

### Program Classification for Autonomous Operation

The Jetson serves as an autonomous robot brain that must operate independently of SSH connections. All programs fall into one of three classes:

#### **Class 1: Development Tools** (SSH-Dependent - Expected Behavior)
Programs meant for development, testing, and human-in-the-loop training. **Should terminate when SSH disconnects.**

**Characteristics:**
- Interactive debugging and testing
- Console output for developers
- Manual intervention required
- Located in `SimpleTests/` with `test_*` or `demo_*` prefix

**Examples:**
```python
# SimpleTests/test_display_manager.py
# SimpleTests/interactive_chat.py  
# SimpleTests/demo_camera_manager.py
```

**Execution:** Direct via SSH (no special handling needed)
```bash
python3 SimpleTests/test_hardware.py
```

#### **Class 2: Critical Robot Services** (Must Survive SSH Disconnection)
Core robot brain functionality that enables autonomous operation. **Must continue running when SSH disconnects.**

**Characteristics:**
- Autonomous control loops
- Sensor fusion and decision making
- Emergency monitoring
- Safety-critical operations

**Future Examples:**
```python
# Services/robot_control_service.py
# Services/sensor_fusion_service.py
# Services/emergency_monitor_service.py
```

**Execution:** Via systemd service (survives disconnections, restarts on crash)
```bash
sudo systemctl start robot-control
sudo systemctl enable robot-control  # Auto-start on boot
```

**Implementation Requirements:**
- Signal handling (SIGTERM, SIGHUP)
- Graceful shutdown mechanisms
- Logging to systemd journal
- PID file management
- Automatic restart on failure

#### **Class 3: Background Monitoring** (Should Survive SSH Disconnection)
Non-critical ambient displays and monitoring. **Should persist but robot can function if they stop.**

**Characteristics:**
- Visual feedback displays
- System health monitoring
- Data logging and visualization
- Status indicators

**Examples:**
```python
# SimpleTests/heartbeat_screensaver.py (current)
# Future: system_monitor_display.py
# Future: training_data_collector.py
```

**Execution:** Via nohup or screen (persists after SSH disconnect)
```bash
nohup python3 SimpleTests/heartbeat_screensaver.py > /tmp/heartbeat.log 2>&1 &

# Or use screen for interactive access
screen -S monitor
python3 system_monitor.py
# Detach: Ctrl+A, D
```

### The Fundamental Question

Before creating any new program, ask:

> **"Should this keep running if the robot is alone in a room?"**

- ‚úÖ **YES** ‚Üí Class 2 (Critical Service) - Use systemd
- ü§î **MAYBE** ‚Üí Class 3 (Background Monitor) - Use nohup/screen  
- ‚ùå **NO** ‚Üí Class 1 (Development Tool) - SSH-attached is fine

### Naming Conventions

Follow these conventions to make program classification immediately clear:

```python
# Class 1: Development Tools
test_*.py          # Unit/integration tests
demo_*.py          # Interactive demonstrations
interactive_*.py   # Human-in-the-loop interfaces

# Class 2: Critical Services  
*_service.py       # Should become systemd service
*_control.py       # Core robot control loops

# Class 3: Background Monitors
*_monitor.py       # System monitoring displays
*_screensaver.py   # Ambient displays
*_logger.py        # Background data collection
```

### Migration Checklist for Autonomous Programs

When creating Class 2 or Class 3 programs:

**Class 2 (Critical Services):**
- [ ] Implements signal handling (SIGTERM, SIGHUP, SIGINT)
- [ ] Has graceful shutdown with resource cleanup
- [ ] Logs to file/journal instead of console
- [ ] Creates PID file for process management
- [ ] Has systemd service file in `/systemd` directory
- [ ] Documents installation and service management
- [ ] Handles hardware manager acquire/release on shutdown

**Class 3 (Background Monitors):**
- [ ] Can be safely killed without data loss
- [ ] Logs to file (not console)
- [ ] Documents nohup/screen usage in docstring
- [ ] Releases hardware resources on exit
- [ ] Includes process check in status scripts

### Manager Pattern
All hardware access follows the acquire/release pattern:

```python
class HardwareManager:
    def acquire(self):
        """Acquire exclusive access to hardware resource."""
        # Thread lock + file lock for process safety
        
    def release(self):
        """Release hardware resource."""
        # Always cleanup, even on exceptions
        
    def operation(self):
        """Hardware operation requiring acquired access."""
        if not self._acquired:
            raise RuntimeError("Must acquire before use")
```

### Thread Safety
- **All hardware managers must be thread-safe**
- Use `threading.Lock()` for thread safety
- Use `fcntl.lockf()` for process-level safety
- Always provide acquire/release methods

### Error Handling
- **Hardware reliability over strict typing**
- Use explicit try/except with logging
- Prefer returning error states over raising exceptions
- Log hardware errors with context information

## Testing

### Hardware Testing
- Test on actual Jetson hardware when possible
- Provide mock testing for CI environments
- Include performance benchmarks for hardware operations

### Test Categories
```bash
# Unit tests for individual components
python3 SimpleTests/test_display_manager.py

# Integration tests for complete systems  
python3 SimpleTests/demo_display_manager.py

# Interactive tests for manual verification
python3 SimpleTests/interactive_chat.py
```

## Documentation

### Code Documentation
- **Docstrings**: Use Google-style docstrings for public methods
- **Inline comments**: Explain hardware-specific operations
- **Type hints**: Optional, hardware code often requires dynamic typing

### Documentation Updates
When adding new features:
1. Update relevant README.md sections
2. Add documentation to `docs/` folder if creating new subsystems
3. Update `docs/README.md` with new documentation references
4. Include usage examples in docstrings

## Git Workflow

### Branch Management
- **Main branch**: `master` (stable, deployable)
- **Feature branches**: `feature/description` or `fix/issue-description`
- **Testing**: Test on hardware before merging to master

### Commit Standards
```bash
# Good commit messages
feat: add Display_Manager with hardware-accelerated graphics
fix: resolve I2C communication timeout in OLED_Manager  
docs: update development environment setup guide
refactor: optimize memory usage in StreamingMicManager

# Include scope when relevant
feat(display): add GStreamer camera integration
fix(audio): handle USB microphone disconnection gracefully
```
