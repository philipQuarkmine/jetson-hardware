# IMX708 Integration Safety Plan & Rollback Guide

## üõ°Ô∏è ROLLBACK SAFETY NET

**Current Safe State:** `pre-imx708-working-state` tag
- ‚úÖ USB Camera fully functional (480x640 capture working)
- ‚úÖ Display_Manager complete (1280x1024 display working)  
- ‚úÖ Dual Camera_Manager architecture ready
- ‚úÖ All existing agent functionality preserved

## üîÑ ROLLBACK PROCEDURES

### If IMX708 Build Fails - Code Rollback
```bash
cd /home/phiip/jetson-hardware
git checkout pre-imx708-working-state
# This restores all code to working state
```

### If System Becomes Unbootable - System Rollback
```bash
# Boot from recovery/external media if needed
sudo cp /boot/Image.backup /boot/Image  # Restore original kernel
sudo nano /boot/extlinux/extlinux.conf  # Restore original config
sudo reboot
```

### Emergency System Recovery
```bash
# If all else fails, reflash Jetson with JetPack 6.0
# SDK Manager -> JetPack 6.0 -> Flash
# Then restore code from git backup
```

## üìç BREADCRUMB TRAIL

### Pre-Integration State (SAFE POINT)
- **Kernel:** Stock JetPack 6.0 (5.15.148-tegra)
- **Boot Config:** `/boot/extlinux/extlinux.conf` with IMX477 overlay  
- **Camera Status:** USB camera working, CSI camera not detected
- **System Status:** Fully functional, desktop disabled, GPU optimized

### Integration Checkpoints (SAVE POINTS)
1. **Checkpoint 1:** JetPack sources downloaded and extracted
2. **Checkpoint 2:** RidgeRun patch successfully applied
3. **Checkpoint 3:** Kernel compilation completed
4. **Checkpoint 4:** New kernel/modules installed
5. **Checkpoint 5:** IMX708 detected on I2C bus
6. **Checkpoint 6:** GStreamer pipeline working

### System Backup Files (AUTO-CREATED)
- `/boot/Image.backup` - Original working kernel
- `/boot/dtb/original-*.dtb` - Original device tree files
- `~/jetson-backup-$(date).tar.gz` - Complete system backup

## üéØ SUCCESS CRITERIA

**Minimum Success:** IMX708 camera detected and capturing frames
**Full Success:** Dual camera system with auto-detection working
**Bonus Success:** 4608x2592@14fps capture with optimal performance

## üö® ABORT CONDITIONS

**Abort if:**
- System becomes unbootable after 3 attempts
- I2C bus damage detected (hardware failure)
- Build process fails after 2 clean attempts
- Time investment exceeds 8 hours

**When aborting:**
1. Document what failed in this file
2. Execute rollback procedure
3. Order IMX477 camera as Plan B
4. Preserve learning for future attempt

## üìö LEARNING DOCUMENTATION

### What We're Learning
- Linux kernel cross-compilation
- Device tree overlay management
- CSI camera hardware integration
- JetPack development workflow

### Key Commands to Master
```bash
# Kernel compilation
make ARCH=arm64 CROSS_COMPILE=aarch64-linux-gnu- defconfig
make ARCH=arm64 menuconfig
make ARCH=arm64 Image dtbs modules

# Device tree compilation
dtc -I dts -O dtb -o output.dtbo input.dts

# Module installation
sudo insmod nv_imx708.ko
sudo modprobe nv_imx708
```
